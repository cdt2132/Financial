<h2>Configuring Character Sets</h2>
<p>
QuickFIX/J has limited support for configuring character sets to be used in
decoding and encoding messages. However, the use of <em>multibyte</em> characters in
FIX messages is not yet officially supported by QuickFIX/J although some users have 
modified their code to allow it.
</p>
<p>
By default QuickFIX/J is configured to use the ISO-8859-1 character set. This can
be modified at the JVM level (not per session) by using the 
<code>org.quickfixj.CharsetSupport.setCharSet</code>
</p>
method.
